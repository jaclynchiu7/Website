        <h2>Volleyball</h2> 
        <div class='textbox center'>
            I started playing volleyball when I was in 6th grade. I first started because my brother played and I copied all his activities. From that time, I played school volleybal all throughout middle and high school, in addition to a couple years in club. Volleyball has taught me how to work as a team and has created many wonderful memories.

        <h2>Flute</h2> 
        <div>
            I played flute ever since 4th grade and played for my school band and orchestra. Starting 8th grade, I asked my parents to take private lessons in order to improve my skills. I participated in multiple competitions and played in many duets and groups.
